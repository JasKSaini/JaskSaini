### Hi👋I'm JasKSaini, and here's little bit about me:

:books:I create user manuals and plan platform migrations as a Technical Writer at LinkedIn

:key:Communication is the key to overcome any hurdle/gap- I live by this mantra in both my personal & professional life.

:woman_teacher: When I'm not playing with words, I volunteer to teach Punjabi to middle and high schoolers at Punjabi School Bothell- Yes I've got B.Ed degree and now finally putting it to good use!:smiley::pencil2:
